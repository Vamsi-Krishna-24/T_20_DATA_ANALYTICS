Developing a comprehensive T20 World Cup cricket data analytics system involves a multi-step approach, from data acquisition to insightful modeling and user-friendly access. Below, I'll expand on the key stages of this process:

Data Acquisition and Preparation:
Web Scraping and Data Extraction:
Utilize Python's BeautifulSoup and other relevant libraries to scrape historical T20 World Cup cricket data from ESPN's website. Extract data from multiple pages and organize it into a usable format.

CSV File Creation and Organization:
Create CSV files for each category of data (Batsmen, Bowlers, Match, Players). Structure the data in a way that aligns with the intended analysis.

Data Cleaning and Processing:
Utilize Python's Pandas library to clean the acquired data. Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform any necessary data transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Data Classification:
Classify the cleaned data into four main datasets: Batsmen summary, Bowlers summary, Match summary, and Players stats. Ensure each dataset contains relevant and meaningful information.

Insightful Modeling:
Defining Performance Criteria:
Define 21+ criteria for evaluating player and team performance. These criteria can cover various aspects such as batting average, bowling economy, strike rates, etc.

Creating Interactive Dashboards:
Utilize Power BI's DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) capabilities to create interactive dashboards. Incorporate the defined performance criteria into the dashboards for visualization and analysis.

Measures and Filtering:
Implement measures within Power BI to filter and analyze the data based on the defined criteria. These measures will aid in the selection of players based on specific parameters and choices.

User-Friendly Access:
Interface Design:
Design a user-friendly interface within Power BI, allowing cricket enthusiasts and team managers to explore data-driven insights easily. Create intuitive visualizations and navigation options.

Dashboard Creation:
Develop four distinct interfaces within the dashboard, each focusing on a specific category (Batsmen, Bowlers, Matches, and Players). Ensure that users can select and view performance and key stats of individual players.

Player Selection Feature:
Implement a feature that allows users to select 11 players based on the defined parameters and choices. This feature should provide flexibility for strategic decision-making.

User Interaction and Analysis:
Enable users to interact with the dashboard, customize views, and gain insights into player and team performance patterns. Empower users to make informed decisions for game analysis and strategy.

By following these steps and incorporating interactive and user-friendly features, the T20 World Cup cricket data analytics system provides valuable insights to cricket enthusiasts and team managers, aiding in strategic decisions and game analysis.
